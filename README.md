# rental_honolulu


**In this kernel I plan to predict the rent price of the apartments in Hawaii islands. I explored the major factors influencing the price and the found out that the n_area of an appartment of the day this advertisement was posted are two major factors influecing the rental price. I have applied variuos regression techniques and obtainde the best results with the XGBoost regressor (R2 = 1) while linear models' R2 did not exceed the 0.6.

	*Based on the correlaton between the factos and the prie I have detected an obvous but interesting dependency of the price vs the day this adv was posted. There is a negative correlation between these two factors: from each dollar that you payed for the rent you can save up to 18 cents if you would choose the ads posted on the specific days.
